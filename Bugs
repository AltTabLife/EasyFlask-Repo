This is a basic text file to list the known bugs and features that need to be worked out


1. Need concise way for in-line element handling such as <i>. Don't want to use another delimiter such as {{}} to conflict with jinja, not to mention this is supposed to be absolute minimal syntax. Need some type of parsing in content-text. For now, since it writes to a file, inline elements can be written as HTML.

2. Need to modify page.page_name parser to turn filenames with spaces into underscores

3. Needs verbose error handling throughout the entire project

4. Need memory management before gets to big and bricks RAM. Constructs are being rewritten throughout the project since tuples, so the old variables need to be discarded.

5. content-text is outputting it's contents to console, while still writing it.
